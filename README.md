# project: Linux Upskill Challenge
This repository documents my experience with the [Linux Upskill Challenge](https://github.com/livialima/linuxupskillchallenge).

## What is it? 🤔
The [The Linux Upskill Challenge](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/) is a hands-on, CLI-driven educational exercise aimed at "those who aspire to get Linux-related jobs in the industry." It serves as an introduction to Linux server administration.

Finished the challenge! Just initialized [CASESTUDY.md](https://github.com/Clifton893/project-LinuxUpskillChallenge/blob/main/CASESTUDY.md) which is a work-in-progress, but almost finished. After that, I will add some finishing touches to this repo for improved readability.

## What did I do? ⚙️
- Spun up an Ubuntu Server 20.04 instance on AWS
- Secured the virtual machine with public key
  - Streamlined SSH connection with `.ssh/config`
- Hardened VM with `ufw`
- Using Vim, added/deleted users; adjusted file permissions
- Installed Apache2 web server
- Wrote a bash script to log attacker IPs
